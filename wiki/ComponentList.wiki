== package: flexlib.controls ==

=== ConvertibleTreeList ===
A control that combines the functionality of the Tree component and the List component.
The !ConvertibleTreeList allows you to use one control and have it display the dataProvider either as a Tree or as a List. You only have to set the dataProvider once. You can set the *mode* at any time to change the display mode.

=== HSlider and VSlider ===
Alternatives to the HSlider and VSlider controls included in the Flex framework. This version of the HSlider and VSlider allows you to drag the region between the thumbs, if the slider has mutliple thumbs. If there is more than one thumb then the region between the leftmost thumb and the rightmost thumb is draggable.

=== PromptingTextInput ===
The !PromptingTextInput component is a small enhancement to standard !TextInput.  It adds the ability to specify a prompt value that displays when the text is empty, similar to how the prompt property of the !ComboBox behaves when there is no selected value.

=== ScrollableMenuBar ===
!ScrollableMenuBar is an extension of !MenuBar that uses flexlib.controls.!ScrollableMenu  instead of using the original mx.controls.Menu. This allows us to specify a maxHeight for the !ScrollableMenuBar and that maxHeight will be used to determine the maxHeight for all the menus that the component generates.

== package: flexlib.containers ==

=== ButtonScrollingCanvas ===
