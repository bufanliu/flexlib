= Introduction =

Use this page to add requests for components.  Put each new component in a new heading, and describe the basic functionality of the component in the body.  Include as much information as possible/necessary.

== Sample Component Request ==

The Sample component should work like X.  It should have a public api that consists of the following:
  * prop1:type
  * someMethod( arg1:type ):returnType

It would be great if it supported styles X, Y, and Z.  

The following events would be nice as well
  * someEvent:EventType
     * prop1:type - Detailed information about X
